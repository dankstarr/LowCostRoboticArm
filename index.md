## Teaching Key Robotics Concepts withthe Help of Low-Cost Manipulator and Augmented Reality

We propose to develop and use a two-link manipulator robot together with context-based tangible augmented reality (AR) display to interactively teach robot kinematics, control and motion planning. The system will be composed of a two-link actuated mechanism with realtime embedded controller, a computer screen for collocated AR display and a dedicated application programming interface (API) based on MATLAB/Simulink MathWorks and Cprogramming languages. Educational material will be produced and made available openly for using the developed system to teach wide range of robotic topics including but not limited to forward/inverse kinematics, Jacobian and velocity kinematics, closed loop control, motion planning and obstacle avoidance, force feedback and bilateral teleoperation, and visual servoing. We believe that this project will be the first one to use tangible augmented reality interfaces to teach robotics with a physical manipulator. The proposed system will be low-cost (<$150) and will be targeting teaching important robotics concepts to a wide range of students: from high school STEM programmes to more advanced 3rd and 4th years engineering and computer science University students. The system will be tested with Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) undergraduate robotics students in 2019-2020 academic year before wider deployment.

### The concept of the proposed educational system.

```
The system will teach the following concepts which are crucial for robotics and automation science and industry:
-manipulators theory and applications
-joint and task spaces
-forward kinematics
-inverse kinematics
-velocity kinematics
-Jacobian
-open loop control
-feedback control
-proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control
-gravity compensation
-motion planning
-obstacle avoidance and potential fields
-haptic feedback and virtual environments
-bilateral robotic systems
```
### Current Objectives
- O1: to develop robust and inexpensive two-link manipulator;
- O2: to develop efficient interactive AR visual interface to teach robot kinematics, 
dynamics, control and manipulator applications;
- O3: to integrate the manipulator real time controller and AR with Matlab Simulink and 
C programming environments;
- O4: to develop and validate through student’s feedback teaching materials to be used 
with the proposed system.

### Deliverables
- D1: An education robotic system (hardware and software). Several copies will be 
developed and made available to interested schools and universities.
- D2: A document describing teaching exercises for the developed robotic system.
- D3: A video tutorial describing how the developed system can be used for teaching.
- D4: A website providing all required development and teaching material to replicate 
the developed system.
- D5: A technical report describing the project outcomes.
- D6: An academic publication describing the results of the project.

### Planned tasks and timeline
- M1-M2: two-link robot manipulator development and prototype manufacturing;
- M3: robustness tests of the first prototype and manufacturing of 5 prototypes;
- M4: using the system during “Aspects of Robotics” module to teaching kinematics
- M5: using the system during “Modelling and control for robots” module to teach dynamics and control;
- M5-M7: developing and integration of tangible AR display;
- M6-M7: summary report for first demonstration and development of complete teaching materials based on first teaching experience;
- M8: using the robot and AR display during “Design and control robotics” module;
- M9-M10: publishing and disseminating the teaching materials, video tutorials and system documentation online;
- M11: organising a webinar to collect the user’s feedback, reflections and to provide guidance on new potential teaching directions;
- M12: preparing for dissemination through international robotics and conferences dissemination and submitting the academic publications.

### Plan for assessment of impact
The following assessment criteria will be employed:
- feedback from the students at Queen Mary University of London;
- feedback from the students at London School of Mathematics and Programming;
- feedback from the students at other Universities involved through our website;
- results of academic assessment of the students at QMUL (comparison of the grades from previous years when the proposed system was not used);
- number of students involved in the University robotics projects (we expect that more students will be interested in pursuing robotics projects after our system is introduced);
- number of visitor and materials downloads from our website;
- number of universities and schools where our robotic system is used;
- amount of funding attracted to support further development.
