# LowCostRoboticArm
Teaching Key Robotics Concepts with the Help of Low-Cost Manipulator and Augmented Reality
We propose to develop and use a two-link manipulator robot together with context-based tangible augmented reality (AR) display to interactively teach robot kinematics, control and 
motion planning. The system will be composed of a two-link actuated mechanism with realtime embedded controller, a computer screen for collocated AR display and a dedicated 
application programming interface (API) based on MATLAB/Simulink MathWorks and Cprogramming languages. Educational material will be produced and made available openly for using the developed system to teach wide range of robotic topics including but not limited to 
forward/inverse kinematics, Jacobian and velocity kinematics, closed loop control, motion  planning and obstacle avoidance, force feedback and bilateral teleoperation, and visual 
servoing. We believe that this project will be the first one to use tangible augmented reality interfaces to teach robotics with a physical manipulator. The proposed system will be low-cost 
(<$150) and will be targeting teaching important robotics concepts to a wide range of students: from high school STEM programmes to more advanced 3rd and 4th years engineering and 
computer science University students. The system will be tested with Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) undergraduate robotics students in 2019-2020 academic year before wider 
deployment
